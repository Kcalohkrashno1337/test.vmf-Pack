# test.vmf-Pack
This pack contains a small testing map.
The map is small, so don't create any too big inside the testing area.
There is a blast door, which can only be opened by you. The door cannot be removed, maniuplated, or stopped.
Because the map is a .vmf file, you will have to go into the Hammer Editor and compile the map yourself.
